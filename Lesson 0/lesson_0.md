#What do I need to know beforehand?

Before starting the web development course, here are some things a person should know or consider:

1. **Basic Computer Skills:** Ensure that you are comfortable using a computer and have a basic understanding of file management, using a text editor, and navigating through different directories (files saved with extension `.html` can be opened in the browser locally, files saved with extension `.css` or `.js` can be called from `.html` files, for adding styles (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript)).

2. **Internet Browsing Knowledge:** Familiarize yourself with web browsers and basic internet navigation. Understand how to search for information and troubleshoot common browser-related issues (Google, AI LLM Systems, StackOverflow, W3Schools....).

3. **Understanding of HTML and CSS Basics:** The course starts with HTML and CSS. Make sure you have a foundational understanding of these technologies as they form the basis for web development.

4. **JavaScript Basics:** It's important to have a basic understanding of JavaScript concepts like variables, data types, functions, and basic DOM manipulation.

5. **Concept of Frontend and Backend:** As the course progresses, it introduces backend technologies like PHP, Python, Java, and Node.js. Have a basic understanding of what frontend and backend development entail, and how they work together to create a full web application.

6. **Introduction to Frameworks:** The course introduces Bootstrap, React.js, and Vue.js. Familiarize yourself with the concept of frontend frameworks and libraries. Understand how they can enhance and streamline the development process.

7. **Basic Programming Concepts:** For lessons involving PHP, Python, and Java, it's beneficial to have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, control structures (if statements, loops), functions, and basic debugging.

8. **Localhost and Web Servers:** Understand the concept of localhost and how web servers work. Lesson 10, 11, and 12 involve setting up a local web server. Be familiar with the process and potential issues.

9. **Database Basics:** While not explicitly mentioned, understanding basic database concepts can be beneficial, especially when dealing with backend development (Lesson 16 involves PHP and a basic registration/login system).

10. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Web development often involves troubleshooting and problem-solving. Develop a mindset for identifying issues, researching solutions, and debugging code.

11. **Version Control (Optional):** Although not mentioned in the curriculum, having a basic understanding of version control systems like Git can be advantageous for collaboration and managing code changes.

12. **Time Management:** The course involves various lessons and projects. Manage your time effectively to practice and reinforce your learning through hands-on projects.

13. **Useful links:**
